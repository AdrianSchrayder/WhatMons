# WhatMons
Code for my PetMod

# Pokedex Changes
Buffed some mons explicitly, but many received buffs through move improvements and ability changes even though nothing about the mon itself was changed.

# Ability Changes
Goal here was to buff seemingly useless abilities and in some cases reinvent them all together

# Move Changes
The idea was to make more moves viable so instead of having to increase movepools (which I still did in some case) mons would just have more options

# Item Changes
This is just a bunch of random tweaks to make more items viable instead of using the same few every battle.
